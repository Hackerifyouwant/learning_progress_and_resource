# CSIE / IT / Software Develop Online Course Info

###### tags: `CSIE` `IT` `Online Courses` `Coursera`
I created this document to organize courses I wanted to learn on Coursera in Summer 2020.

After I'm a homeschooled student, I decided to put my CSIE and programming learning progress, more courses from OCW and other learning websites.

I'm not good at English. Please send PR if there is anything wrong.
